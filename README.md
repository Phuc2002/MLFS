# MLFS
Machine Learning From Scratch

The project aims to build a simple, personal machine learing library using pure Python and related built-in third party libraries without resorting to high-level, advance framework or APIs.

The project is a series of mini tutorials, each tutorial is in the form of short written guide/explanation (README.md).
